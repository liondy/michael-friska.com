service: ERP Solution, Next & Nest Typescript
client: Bank BJB
shortDescription: This was Michael's first official project after graduated from UNPAR. Michael was contacted by a software house in Bandung to develop an app for Bank Jabar Banten (BJB). Turns out it was an ERP Solution for internal team BJB to manage debitur and creditur.
challenge: Apart from this was the first project, this project had many challenges for Michael. The first thing was he was given a half-working source code. It was nice from outside but turns out the logic behind it was very poor. Michael had to learn all the source code (Backend and Frontend) first to be able to know his next move. The second thing was it was a very large project. Michael was only given 2 months to develop it and had to extend the contract 2 times until the app can be fully running.
solution: Because this was a very big project, Michael needed extra collaborations with other teams to perform apps in time. He then asked some of his bestfriends (including Friska) in college to join the project and at the end they managed to create web app for bjb salmon.

A lot of things could be taken fromt this project. The first thing was being able to learn new things fast. Michael was able to perform learning by doing because he only used React Javascript before and never used these language (Nest & Next Typescript) which was the framework of React. Michael also learned the process of devops. This was the first time he performed devops in a real project. The second thing was Michael learned to perform actions in a team. He also learned to manage the team, performing as a Project and Engineering Manager. Although the process was not smooth and had a little conflict, they managed to get back together afterwards. Last thing was the importance of having good friends to support. If Michael and Friska had no friends back in college, they won't be able to perform this project up until the end. Michael and Friska managed to gather 6 of their friends to develop BJB Salmon.

Bigger problem means bigger responsibility, but giving more experience. Michael and the team learned many new things, such as implementing agile methodologies, performing scrum meeting and daily standup. This was a good experience before they were involved in a real company. This was also their first time developing an app with two different environment, meaning deploying an app to a staging and production. They tried to learn cloud native solution (Digital Ocean) to store object in Digital Ocean Spaces and used their Database App also. So, for prospective clients, if you're reading this, don't be afraid as they are capable of doing extraordinary things. Yay!

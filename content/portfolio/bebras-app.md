shortDescription: This is a project developed by Michael. It's an Android App for students to learn computation thinking. Each students will be given 1 Bebras icon. This bebras can be customized with accessories. These accessories can be bought with diamonds. Diamonds are obtained from answering questions. There's lot of questions to be solved from Bebras Indonesia. The questions are grouped per year. Each year has its own difficulties. If students successfully completed 1 set of questions, the app will give them diamonds. These diamonds can be used to buy accessories for Bebras.
challenge:
  During this development, Michael encounter many challenges such as user can manually customize the Bebras by selecting which accessories do they want to use. The bebras that has been customized by the user, has to look exactly the same in the home page. 
solution:
  Michael had to try to synchronize the Bebras from the custom page and the Bebras from the home page. To do that, Michael learned async JS storage so that he could store the accesories that was selected by the user. He then access the accessories from storage and put it in home page Bebras.

This project was for college project that was built by 3 team person. This project was built with React Native (a Javascript Framework). For some reason, this application was never published to Play Store because Michael and the team were unable to dynamically add the questions from outside of code. Because of this, if school commitee wants to add questions to package, it will be difficult.

For those who wanted to see the source code, it is available in Michael's Github: https://github.com/liondy/BebrasApp

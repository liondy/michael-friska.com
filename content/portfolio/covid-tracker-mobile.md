shortDescription: When the first pandemic, Michael has an initiative to make a live covid-19 tracker for all around the world. Using his skills in React Native, he developed an Android Application that delivers real-time data statistic of covid-19 from all around the world.
challenge: When doing this, Michael has a problem to gather covid-19 API from all countries. He has to ensure that user can see all data clearly from all around the world. If the user has no internet, he has to make sure that the app asks wifi connection first.
solution: Michael can finally do it all. He got the API from Github Repo open-source. He learned React Native more deeply than the Bebras App project. At last, his application was published to the APK Store.

This project was initiated by Michael to help people see real-time data statistic of covid-19 from all around the world. This project was built with React Native (a Javascript Framework). This app was published to APK Store: https://www.apkfiles.com/apk-600295/covid-19-tracker

The app was published to APK Store because Google Play refused to published application related to covid-19 as there was no application for tracking covid-19 from hospital or government back then. For those who wanted to see the source code, it is available in Michael's Github: https://github.com/liondy/Covid19TrackerMobile

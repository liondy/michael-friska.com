shortDescription: This is Michael and Friska first project together. We both were asked to design a new look for iFirstRow Sports. It is a sports website where users can stream any kind of sports(football, basketball, rugby, etc). Friska used her skills to design the UI while Michael managed to implement the backend side. In the end, we're both doing a pretty good job after all :)
challenge: The website is emphasized on UI/UX so Friska is the one who stole the show. She had to design the best UI/UX for iFirstRow Sports. It's because she was asked to fix existing website.
solution: Friska really show off her skills and eventually she managed to be an important person for our project. She managed to change the appearance of the website that was "bad" to be more pleasant to look at.

Friska and Michael both success taking this project. Because this website emphasizes on ui/ux, it was not hosted on the internet. We provide the open-source code in Friska's Github: https://github.com/friskac/projectimk

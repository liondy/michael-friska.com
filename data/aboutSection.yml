  ### We design and build ultimate things.

  We're a computer science students from Indonesia. We've been together since July 2018 when we were second year students. Currently, we're working on our undergraduate-thesis, so..good luck to us😟. Friska loves designing things while Michael loves implementing her design. Wow, what a great couple! 

  Apart from our "nerdy" life, we like to hang out, watching movies together, trying new things, and ...eat😝! We tried a lot of food. We are like food-blogger wannabe🤣. Well, that's what most couple do. We also like playing games together and hopefully we can make ones also hehe.
